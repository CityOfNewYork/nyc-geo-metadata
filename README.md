# NYC GIS Metadata
-------------

This document lists metadata sources for data updated and maintained by the NYC Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT).

| Data/Layer Name | Description | Preview |
| ---|---|---|
 | [Address Point](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_AddressPoint.md) | Address points were initially created from data in the Department of City Planning Property Address Directory (PAD) file. Points were created approximately five feet inside building footprints along the correct street frontage. A field collection/verification process was undertaken to validate "multi-valued" addresses contained in the PAD file (i.e. those locations with a range of addresses). Additionally, a statistical sample of PAD single valued addresses was field checked. Approximately 100,000 locations were visited (about 10% of the total). | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/AddressPoint.PNG)
 | [After-School Programs](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_AfterSchoolPrograms.md) | The New York City Department of Youth and Community Development offers engaging high quality programs for young people in all five boroughs of New York City during the hours they are not in school. | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/AfterSchoolProgram.PNG)

 | [Greenthumb](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Greenthumb.md) | As the largest community gardening program in the country, GreenThumb is proud to support community gardens in New York City. There are over 600 member gardens serving 20,000 city residents. Since 1978 GreenThumb has been committed to providing support to help strengthen gardens, strengthen gardener skills, and strengthen communities. GreenThumb's services take the form of materials and technical assistance, including educational workshops. The shapefile includes point representing approximate location of community gardens participating in the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation GreenThumb Program. | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/Greenthumb.PNG)
 | [Historic Districts](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_HistoricDistricts.md) | This dataset contains boundaries and associated attribute information for all designated historic districts or areas under consideration for historic district designation (i.e. calendared) by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), including items that may have been denied designation or overturned. Please note that some areas may have multiple records in the database if different actions were taken over time. Please pay close attention to the "CURRENT" and "LAST_ACTION_ON_BOUNDARY" fields to determine the status of a particular area. The geographic locations of the polygons in this dataset are derived primarily from the Department of City Planning's PLUTO dataset, and therefore discrepancies may arise where the LPC dataset has not been updated with information from the most recent PLUTO releases. Please pay close attention to the field descriptions present in the file's metadata to understand how to use this dataset. And please contact LPC if there are questions or concerns | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/HistoricDistricts.PNG)
 | [Hydro Structure](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_HydroStructure.md) | This feature class contains the following Hydro structures:<br>PIERS = Deck supported by posts extending into the water.<br>JETTY = Structure, usually stone, earth, or concrete extending from shore to lessen erosion, in continuation of river channels at their outlets or into docks, and outside their entrances. Delineated at the water level.<br>SEAWALL = Typically, a seawall is built on the land parallel to the coast, but may also apply to breakwaters that are built into the water. | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/raw/master/Images/FeatureViews/Pier.png)
 | [Hydrography](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Hydrography.md) | This feature class contains water bodies (types listed below) and is generally only updated when the actual shape has changed. These are not updated due to different water levels (e.g., high/low tide). This feature class includes the following subtypes:<br>LAKE/RESERVOIR = lake/reservoir hydro features<br>POND = pond hydro features<br>RIVER = river hydro features<br>STREAM = stream hydro features<br>WETLAND/MARSH = wetland/marsh hydro features<br>BEACH/SHORELINE = beach/shoreline hydro features<br>BAY/OCEAN = bay/ocean hydro features | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/raw/master/Images/FeatureViews/Lake.png)
 | [Landmarks](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Landmarks.md) | This dataset contains information on all items designated or under consideration for designation (i.e. calendared) by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), including items that may have been denied designation or overturned. The dataset contains records for each individual, scenic, or interior landmark, as well as properties or sites located within the boundaries of historic districts. Please note that points in this dataset represent individual buildings in addition to non-building sites (such as vacant lots or monuments) regulated by LPC. It is possible for a single property to have multiple designations (such as individual and interior designations, or individual and historic district). For this reason, it is not uncommon to see multiple points on a single tax lot and multiple records for a single property within the database. Please pay close attention to the "MOST_CURRENT," "BBL_STATUS and "LAST_ACTION_ON_LP" fields, which together denote the designation status of a site/property (see Attribute Definitions for more information). The geographic locations of the points in this dataset are derived primarily from the Department of City Planning's PLUTO data in combination with the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunication's building footprint information. Because this dataset is not automatically updated when changes occur in the underlying dataset, BIN numbers and tax lot information are potentially out of date. Please pay close attention to the field descriptions present in the file's metadata to understand how to use this data set. | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/Landmarks.PNG)
