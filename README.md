| Data/Layer Name | Description | Preview |
| ---|---|---|
[3-D Building Model](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_3DBuildingModel.md) | 3-D Building Models representing every NYC building present in the 2014 aerial survey. Models are based on a hybrid of the CItyGML Level of Detail (LOD) 1 (simple/prismatic buildings with flat roof detail) and LOD 2 (includes roof structure details) with approximately 100 iconic buildings modeled to LOD 2.  Highlights of the model include the differentiation of building components including roof, facades, and ground plane.  | ![image](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doitt/images/content/pages/3d-buildings.png)
[Address Point](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_AddressPoint.md) | Address points are part of the Citywide Street Centerline (CSCL) database. The data represent visually identifiable and Borough President assigned addresses within NYC.  Placement of the address points are approximately five feet within the respective building footprint along  street front the address is assigned.  | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/AddressPoint.PNG)
[Aerial Imagery](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_AerialImagery.md) | Raster file of vertical aerial imagery covering New York City. Imagery is captured every 2 years during spring/summer months and corrected through computer processes to remove distortions caused by elevation changes and camera angles. | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/AerialImagery.PNG)
[Building Footprints](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_BuildingFootprints.md) | Building footprints represent the perimeter outline of each building. Divisions between adjoining buildings are determined by tax lot divisions.  | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Images/FeatureViews/Build_Foot.png)
[Business Improvement Districts](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_BIDs.md) | Polygons representing the extent of Business Improvement Districts (BIDs). A BID is a public/private partnership in which property and business owners elect to make a collective contribution to the maintenance, development, and promotion of their commercial district.  | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/BusinessImprovementDistricts.PNG)

[Digital Elevation Model](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_DigitalElevationModel.md) | A bare-earth, hydro-flattened, digital-elevation surface model derived from 2010 Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data.   Surface models are raster representations derived by interpolating the LiDAR point data to produce a seamless gridded elevation data set.  A Digital Elevation Model  (DEM) is a surface model generated from the LiDAR returns that correspond to the ground with all buildings, trees and other above ground features removed.  The cell values represent the elevation of the ground relative to sea level.   The DEM was generated by interpolating the LiDAR ground points to create a 1 foot resolution seamless surface. Cell values correspond to the ground elevation value (feet) above sea level. A proprietary approach to surface model generation was developed that reduced spurious elevation values in areas where there were no LiDAR returns, primarily beneath buildings and over water. This was combined with a detailed manual QA/QC process, with emphasis on accurate representation of docks and bare-earth within 2000ft of the water bodies surrounding each of the five boroughs. | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/DEM.PNG)
