# NYC GIS Metadata
-------------

This document lists metadata sources for data updated and maintained by the NYC Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT).

| Data/Layer Name | Description | Preview |
| ---|---|---|
[Address Point](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_AddressPoint.md) | Address points were initially created from data in the Department of City Planning Property Address Directory (PAD) file. Points were created approximately five feet inside building footprints along the correct street frontage. A field collection/verification process was undertaken to validate "multi-valued" addresses contained in the PAD file (i.e. those locations with a range of addresses). Additionally, a statistical sample of PAD single valued addresses was field checked. Approximately 100,000 locations were visited (about 10% of the total). | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/AddressPoint.PNG)
[Building Footprints](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_BuildingFootprints.md) | This feature class contains building footprints. Each footprint represents the perimenter extent of the building. | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/PointsOfInterest.PNG)
[Business Improvement Districts](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_BIDs.md) | This dataset includes polygons representing the location of Business Improvement Districts (BIDs). A BID is a public/private partnership in which property and business owners elect to make a collective contribution to the maintenance, development, and promotion of their commercial district.  | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/BusinessImprovementDistricts.PNG)
[Contours](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Contours.md) | This dataset includes polylines representing citywide 2-ft elevation contours. | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/Contours.PNG)
[Digital Elevation Model](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_DigitalElevationModel.md) | This bare-earth, hydro-flattened, digital-elevation surface model derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data represents the most accurate estimate of elevation for the City of New York.  Surface models are raster representations derived by interpolating the LiDAR point data to produce a seamless gridded elevation data set.  A Digital Elevation Model  (DEM) is a surface model generated from the LiDAR returns that correspond to the ground.  Buildings, trees and other above ground features are not included.  The cell values represent the elevation of the ground relative to sea level.  DEM applications include flood and storm surge modeling, hydrologic flow mapping, and site design. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from LiDAR collected in the spring of 2010 over New York City. A DEM models the ground surface, which is to say that above ground features (e.g. trees and buildings) are not present. The DEM was generated by interpolating the LiDAR ground points to create a 1 foot resolution seamless surface. Cell values correspond to the ground elevation value (feet) above sea level. A proprietary approach to surface model generation was developed that reduced spurious elevation values in areas where there were no LiDAR returns, primarily beneath buildings and over water. This was combined with a detailed manual QA/QC process, with emphasis on accurate representation of docks and bare-earth within 2000ft of the water bodies surrounding each of the five boroughs. | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/DEM.PNG)
[Planimetrics](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_AgencyServiceCenter.md) | Planimetric mapping is the capture of geographic features from aerial survey that are traditionally mapped in two dimensions. NYC DOITT first developed a planimetric database in 2000. Today, the database includes features for [Building Footprints](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#building-footprint), [Boardwalk](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#boardwalk), [Cooling Towers](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#cooling-towers), [Curb](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#curb), [Elevation](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#elevation), [Hydro Structure](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#hydro-structure), [Hydrography](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#hydrography), [Median](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#median), [Misc Struct Poly](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#misc-struct-poly), [Open Space](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#open-space), [Park](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#park), [Parking Lot](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#parking-lot), [Pavement Edge](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#pavement-edge), [Plaza](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#plaza), [Railroad](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#railroad), [Railroad Structure](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#railroad-structure), [Retaining Wall](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#retaining-wall), [Roadbed](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#roadbed), [Shoreline](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#shoreline), [Sidewalk](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#sidewalk), [Sidewalk Centerline](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#sidewalk-centerline), [Swimming Pool](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#swimming-pool), [Transport Structure](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#transport-structure), and [Under Construction](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-planimetrics/blob/master/Capture_Rules.md#under-construction). | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/planimetrics_2014.png)
[Points Of Interest](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_PointsOfInterest.md) | The Point of Interest (CommonPlace) points are a compilation of what the different city agencies consider to be a Common Place or Place/Point of Interest. Sources for the data include: - NYPD (Sprint and PCAD) - FDNY (Starfire and EMSCAD) - OEM Hospitals - DCP Special Address File - DoITT - Points of Interest, NYCHA developments, Schools - DPR Parks Properties Points were either loaded from a previously existing point feature class or they were created. The different methods to create the points include: manual location based on Orthophotography, buildings and/or parcels based on an address or known location, automatically using ArcMap functions, or by entering the centerline XY coordinate of the location from Geosupport. | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/PointsOfInterest.PNG)
[Street Centerline](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_StreetCenterline.md) | The original source of geomtry for centerline was Linear Integrated Ordered Network (LION), which was maintained by the Department of City Planning. Centerline is a single line representation of New York City streets containing address ranges and other information such as traffic directions, road types, segment types. Street Centerline is part of the Citywide Street Centerline (CSCL) enterprise geospatial database and data maintenance system that supports multiple agencies, including the emergency 911 dispatching systems.  | ![image](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Images/StreetCenterline.PNG)
