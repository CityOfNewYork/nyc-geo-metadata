**Purpose** |The Published Citywide Street Centerline (CSCL) is a comprehensive and authoritative database for the City of New York. It comprises the published version of various geographic features and data. It is used by numerous city agencies including Public Safety call centers, the Department of City Planning's Geosupport, and FDNY EMS dispatch systems. The published CSCL database is accessible to the public and will support the Next Generation 911 system.
**Description** |This published CSCL database is an ESRI file geodatabase and consists of a feature dataset, 40 feature classes, 3 tables, and 2 relationship classes. The source data for the published CSCL database is updated daily by the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI) and the Department of City Planning (DCP) and is governed by 8 city agencies.
