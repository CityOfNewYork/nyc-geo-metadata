**Purpose** |The NYC Digital Tax Map (DTM) is a product of three main sources: COGIS, RPAD, and the original Mylar based Tax Map.    COGIS, which stands for Computerized Geographic Information System, was the original digital tax block and lot base map for the City of New York. Created in the late 1970s by the NYC Department of City Planning, it would become the digital vector based linework that the DTM's polygons are based on.<br><br>RPAD, or Real Property Assessment Data, was created in 1981 by the NYC Department of Finance as a mainframe application used to assess property taxes.  Many of the features and attributes currently found in the DTM were obtained via RPAD.  RPAD is currently being used internally by the DOF, but will be replaced by a new system titled "PTS".<br><br>Dating back to the 19th century, the mylar based Tax Map was the official record of tax block and lots for the City of New York and was referred to and updated by the Tax Map Unit until 2008.  This was a series of ink based hand drawn maps based off of surveys, and essentially a physical copy of the current DTM.  In 2008, the most recent mylar based map was scanned and used to ensure that the COGIS file contained and conformed to all of the lots on the original map.   This map is still accessible via ACRIS and at the NYC Department of Finance 66 John Street location.
