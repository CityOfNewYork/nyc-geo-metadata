**Purpose** |CSCL (Citywide Street Centerline) is a Geodatabase managed by the Department of City Planning (DCP) and the Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI). The CSCL database was developed subsequent to 9/11 to ensure that all the NYC public safety agencies were working with GIS data from a common source. CSCL data feeds the NYPD 911 call-takers maps as well as each of the unique dispatch systems used by NYPD, FDNY, and FDNY EMS. It also supplies city agencies and the public with an authoritative source for a variety of other GIS data. CSCL is used to produce the Dept. of City Planning’s Geosupport software, a geocoding system widely used by city agencies and the public.
**Description** |CSCL is governed by 7 city agencies: DCP, OTI, NYPD, FDNY, OEM, DOT, and DEP. CSCL centrally maintains a database of street, address, common place, and additional location data to support public safety dispatching, serving as the authoritative source for New York City’s geographic data. The data is edited on a daily basis and updates are synchronized nightly to NYPD, FDNY, DOT, DSNY, OEM and OTI-PSGIS. The CSCL database contains 72 feature classes, 38 tables and 46 relationships.
**Publication Dates** |**Last Update**: Weekly<br>**Metadata**: 12/11/2024<br>**Update Frequency**: Features are updated daily by staff and released publicly on [NYCMaps](https://nycmaps-nyc.hub.arcgis.com/).

## Feature Classes 

Some feature classes in the geodatabase are not described here because they are not actively maintained or used.

| Feature Class | Summary | Description |
| ---|---|---|
|AccessPoint|Provides Emergency Services with additional information on accessing locations.|Access points are primarily along the street and represent a point of access to one or more entrances of a building (mostly schools and gated building complexes).  In some cases, they are also in the interior of a building complex, because of internal fences or gates. In other cases, an access point represents access to an alley or walkway on the rear or side of a building. Access Points were originally field collected. There is no known source available to compare the field collected data, either for spatial location or attribute accuracy.|
|AddressPoint|Address points supplement the address information supplied by CSCL centerlines. Some computer aided dispatch systems use address points as the primary source for locating an address.|AddressPoints model actual addresses present in the field. AddressPoints are created approximately five feet inside building footprints along the correct street frontage. Address points were initially created from data in the Department of City Planning Property Address Directory (PAD) file.|
|AdjacentBoroughBoundary|Used internally by public safety systems. |Polygon feature class that is used in a downstream process to alter the Borough for areas where FDNY and NYPD handle 911 calls differently. e.g. FDNY handles Roosevelt Island as Manhattan and NYPD handles Roosevelt Island as Queens. Polygons are drawn ad-hoc but using Centerlines and Boroughs as a reference. Data is maintained by OTI-Public Safety GIS.|

| Node                  | Nodes are useful for several reasons: 1) Assignment of a value to an intersection (e.g. reference an incident to an intersection, 2) Used to help assign location to other CSCSL datasets (e.g. Virtual Intersections, Special Intersections) and 3) Required for data editing to support Geosupport. | Nodes represent the locations of any combination of linear features in CSCL (a topological junction). Data is maintained by DCP.                                                                                                                         |
| NonStreetFeature      | The following are non-street feature subtypes: 1) Census_block 2) District_Boundary 3) Election_District 4) Other 5) Physical_Non_ST_Feature 6) Pier_Outline 7) School_District | NonStreetFeature is a single line representation of non-street features. The LION file includes some of these and are identified by Feature Type. Data is maintained by DCP.                                                                            |
| Rail                  | To provide the ownership of line, the type of line, and the level code of line. To assist in emergency dispatch.   | Rail is a single line representation of New York City railroads containing route and other information. Data is maintained by DCP.                                                                                                                                                             |
| ReferenceMarker       | 1.Reference markers are positioned approximately every one-tenth of a mile along arterials. 2.The reference marker panel legends contain up to twelve alphanumeric characters of identifying information, consisting of a NYS DOT route identification code, identifiers of the county/locality, and a reference marker sequencing number. Reference markers are part of CSCL to assist in identifying a location along an arterial highway. | Reference markers are small signs that are positioned systematically at points along state-maintained roads and highways. NYS DOT maintains a system of reference markers affixed to posts, walls, railings, and other prominent physical features. Data is maintained by DCP.                      |
| Shoreline             | To depict the shoreline of New York City.                                                             | Shoreline is a single line representation of New York City shorelines. Data is maintained by DCP.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
