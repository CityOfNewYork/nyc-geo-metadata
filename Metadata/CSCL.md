**Purpose** |CSCL (Citywide Street Centerline) is a geodatabase managed by the Department of City Planning (DCP) and the Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI). The CSCL database was created after 9/11 to ensure that all NYC public safety agencies use the same GIS data. CSCL data is used by NYPD 911 call-takers, NYPD, FDNY, and FDNY EMS dispatch systems. It is also an authoritative source for various other GIS data, used by city agencies and the public. CSCL helps produce the Dept. of City Planningâ€™s Geosupport software, a widely used geocoding system.
**Description** |CSCL is managed by seven city agencies: DCP, OTI, NYPD, FDNY, OEM, DOT, and DEP. It maintains a central database of street, address, common place, and other location data to support public safety dispatching. This database is the main source of geographic data for New York City. The data is updated daily and synchronized every night with NYPD, FDNY, DOT, DSNY, OEM, and OTI-PSGIS. The CSCL database includes 72 feature classes, 38 tables, and 46 relationships.
**Publication Dates** |**Last Update**: Weekly<br>**Metadata**: 12/11/2024<br>**Update Frequency**: Features are updated daily by staff and released publicly on [NYCMaps](https://nycmaps-nyc.hub.arcgis.com/).

## Feature Classes 

Some feature classes in the geodatabase are not described here because they are not actively maintained or used.

| Feature Class | Summary | Description |
| ---|---|---|
|AccessPoint|Provides Emergency Services with additional information on accessing locations.|Access points are primarily along the street and represent a point of access to one or more entrances of a building (mostly schools and gated building complexes).  In some cases, they are also in the interior of a building complex, because of internal fences or gates. In other cases, an access point represents access to an alley or walkway on the rear or side of a building. Access Points were originally field collected. There is no known source available to compare the field collected data, either for spatial location or attribute accuracy.|
|AddressPoint|Address points supplement the address information supplied by CSCL centerlines. Some computer aided dispatch systems use address points as the primary source for locating an address.|AddressPoints model actual addresses present in the field. AddressPoints are created approximately five feet inside building footprints along the correct street frontage. Address points were initially created from data in the Department of City Planning Property Address Directory (PAD) file.|
|AdjacentBoroughBoundary|Used internally by public safety systems. |Polygon feature class that is used in a downstream process to alter the Borough for areas where FDNY and NYPD handle 911 calls differently. e.g. FDNY handles Roosevelt Island as Manhattan and NYPD handles Roosevelt Island as Queens. Polygons are drawn ad-hoc but using Centerlines and Boroughs as a reference. Data is maintained by OTI-Public Safety GIS.|
