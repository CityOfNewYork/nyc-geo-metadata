**Purpose** |CSCL (Citywide Street Centerline) is a Geodatabase managed by the Department of City Planning (DCP) and the Office of Technology and Innovation (OTI). The CSCL database was developed subsequent to 9/11 to ensure that all the NYC public safety agencies were working with GIS data from a common source. CSCL data feeds the NYPD 911 call-takers maps as well as each of the unique dispatch systems used by NYPD, FDNY, and FDNY EMS. It also supplies city agencies and the public with an authoritative source for a variety of other GIS data. CSCL is used to produce the Dept. of City Planning’s Geosupport software, a geocoding system widely used by city agencies and the public.
**Description** |CSCL is governed by 7 city agencies: DCP, OTI, NYPD, FDNY, OEM, DOT, and DEP. CSCL centrally maintains database of street, address, common place, and additional location data to support public safety dispatching, serving as the authoritative source for New York City’s geographic data. The data is edited on a daily basis and updates are synchronized nightly to NYPD, FDNY, DOT, DSNY, OEM and OTI-PSGIS. The CSCL database contains 72 feature classes, 38 tables and 46 relationships that are described below.
