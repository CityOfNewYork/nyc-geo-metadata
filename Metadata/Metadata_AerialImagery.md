**Purpose** |Historical imagery was aquired from a variety of sources. Since 1996, NYC DoITT has captured orthophotography. Starting in 2004, aerial imagery has been captured on a 2 year cycle. These imagery provide: a basis for the planimetric updates; a visual record of the City at specific intervals; a visual base for capturing and recording additional spatial data; and allow for a visual analysis of the City.
**Description** |Raster file of vertical aerial imagery covering New York City. Imagery is captured every 2 years during spring/summer months and corrected through computer processes to remove distortions caused by elevation changes and camera angles.
**Source(s)** |[New York State Statewide Digital Orthoimagery Program](http://gis.ny.gov/gateway/orthoprogram/ortho_options.htm)
**Publication Dates** |**Data**: <br>**Last Update**: 2016<br>**Metadata**: 1/17/2017<br>**Update Frequency**: Aerial imagery has been captured every 2 years since 2004.
