**Purpose** |This feature class is part of the planimetrics database used by the NYC DOITT GIS group to maintain and distribute an accurate 'basemap' for NYC. The basemap provides the foundation upon virtually all other geospatial data with New York. Digital planimetrics are derived using the imagery products delivered with the 2014 New York Statewide Flyover (see Summary for specific flight dates), which includes raw imagery collected to support the generation of 0.5 Ft Ground Sample Distance (GSD) natural color imagery. 
**Description** |Cooling towers are structures typically found on the roofs of large buildings that enclose large fans used for ventilation and cooling. Only cooling towers greater than 4ft in diameter were captured.
**Source(s)** |Current imagery
**Publication Dates** |**Data**: 03/25/16<br>**Last Update**: 08/27/16<br>**Metadata**: 12/02/16<br>**Update Frequency**: 
**Available Formats** |File Geodatabase Feature Class as part of the Planimetrics geodatabase and individual shapefile on the [NYC Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Cooling-Tower/miz8-534t)
**Use Limitations** |While all possible measures have been taken to ensure the accuracy of this data, the City of New York assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the data for their purposes.
