**Purpose** |This feature class is part of the planimetrics database used by the NYC DOITT GIS group to maintain and distribute an accurate 'basemap' for NYC. The basemap provides the foundation upon virtually all other geospatial data with New York. Digital planimetrics are derived using the imagery products delivered with the 2014 New York Statewide Flyover (see Summary for specific flight dates), which includes raw imagery collected to support the generation of 0.5 Ft Ground Sample Distance (GSD) natural color imagery. 
**Description** |This feature class contains all in-ground swimming pools, regardless of shape, on the inside (water) of the pool.
**Source(s)** |Current imagery and previous planimetric database
**Publication Dates** |**Data**: 03/14/16<br>**Last Update**: 08/27/16<br>**Metadata**: 12/02/16<br>**Update Frequency**: 
**Available Formats** |File Geodatabase Feature Class as part of the Planimetrics geodatabase and individual shapefile on the [NYC Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Swimming-Pools/j7ww-5ipv)
**Use Limitations** |While all possible measures have been taken to ensure the accuracy of this data, the City of New York assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the data for their purposes.
