## 1. Identification
---------------------------------------------
|     |     |
| --- | --- |
**Purpose** |
**Description** |3-D Building Models are representations of every NYC building present in the 2014 aerial survey. 
**Source(s)** |Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications (DOITT)
**Publication Dates** |**Data**: 04/18/2016<br>**Last Update**: 04/18/2016<br>**Metadata**: 12/28/2016<br>**Update Frequency**: The 3-D model was a one-time capture. Updates and extensions may be considered in the future.

## 2. Data Quality and Specifications
---------------------------------------------
|     |     |
| --- | --- |
**Horizontal Coordinate System** |New York State Plane Coordinates, Long Island East Zone, NAD83, US foot
**Resolution** |
**Spatial Coverage** |New York City, NY
**Temporal Coverage** |Data is based on 2014 aerial survey.
**Positional Accuracy** |
**Features Captured** |All major roof structures are modeled, including pitched roofs. 
**Features Excluded** |Domes and rounded roofs are not modeled. All roof appendages, such as chimneys, parapets, spindles, and antenna are also not included. 
**Capture and Update Notes** |Using the Open Geospatial Consortium's CityGML specification as the basis, the NYC 3-D Building Massing Model was developed to a hybrid specification combining elements from Level of Detail (LOD) 1 and 2. Highlights of the model include the differentiation of building components including roof, facades and ground plane. <br><br> The model was a one-time capture. If the model is useful, future updates and extensions will be considered.
