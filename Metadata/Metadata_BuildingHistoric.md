As with the building footprint features, historic footprints represent the full perimeter outline of each building as viewed from directly above. Additional attribute information maintained for each feature includes: Building Identification Number (BIN); Borough, Block, and Lot information; ground elevation at building base; roof height above ground elevation; construction year; demolition year; and feature type.
