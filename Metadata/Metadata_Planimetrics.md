**Purpose** |One of the core functions of the NYC Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) GIS group is to maintain and distribute an accurate 'basemap' for NYC. Collectively, the basemap includes the digital orthophotography and planimetric features. The basemap provides the foundation upon which virtually all other geospatial data within New York government is registered. Ensuring its completeness and accuracy is fundamental to the Group's core mission. 
**Description** |Planimetric mapping is the capture of geographic features from aerial survey that are traditionally mapped in two dimensions. NYC DOITT first developed a planimetric database in 2000. Today, the database includes features for [Building Footprints](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_BuildingFootprints.md), [Boardwalk](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Boardwalk.md), [Cooling Towers](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_.md), [Curb](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Curb.md), [Elevation](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Elevation.md), [Hydro Structure](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_HydroStructure.md), [Hydrography](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Hydrography.md), [Median](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Median.md), [Misc Struct Poly](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_MiscStructPoly.md), [Open Space](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_OpenSpace.md), [Park](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Park.md), [Parking Lot](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_ParkingLot.md), [Pavement Edge](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_PavementEdge.md), [Plaza](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Plaza.md), [Railroad](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Railroad.md), [Railroad Structure](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_RailroadStructure.md), [Retaining Wall](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_RetainingWall.md), [Roadbed](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Roadbed.md), [Shoreline](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Shoreline.md), [Sidewalk](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_Sidewalk.md), [Sidewalk Centerline](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_SidewalkCenterline.md), [Swimming Pool](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_SwimmingPool.md), [Transport Structure](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_TransportStructure.md), and [Under Construction](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/nyc-geo-metadata/blob/master/Metadata/Metadata_UnderConstruction.md).
**Source(s)** |The source imagery for the current planimetric update was captured on the following dates:<br>Manhattan - June 24, 2014<br>The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island - April 1st through April 25th, 2014<br>Final delivery of all imagery - April 10, 2015
**Publication Dates** |**Data**: 03/10/16<br>**Last Update**: 06/02/16<br>**Metadata**: 12/02/16<br>**Update Frequency**: An update to the planimetric database was done in 2004. This update was based on aerial surveys from 2001 (Manhattan and Staten Island) and 2002 (Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens). This update conformed to the previous database design. In 2006, DoITT formalized the update frequency of the planimetric database and aerial surveys. The aerial photography would be captured on a two-year cycle and the planimetrics a four-year cycle. The first regularly-scheduled planimetric update was based on the 2006 aerial photography and delieverd in 2008.<br><br>With each subsequent update, refinements have been made. New features and domains have been added, obsolete features have been removed, features have been captured in three dimensions, a seamless database has been produced and the time between aerial capture and delivery of the planimetrics has been shortened. For a complete list of the captures, see below. 



Based on the stereo models developed from the raw imagery and aerotriangulation, the planimetric features were updated or new features captured for the entire City. The project began March 2015 and was completed February 2016. 
**Available Formats** |Geodatabase. The geodatabase includes feature classes for individual feature classes collected through the planimetric update. 
**Use Limitations** |While all possible measures have been taken to ensure the accuracy of this data, the City of New York assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the data for their purposes.
