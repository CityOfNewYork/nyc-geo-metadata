## 1. Identification
---------------------------------------------

| --- | --- |
**Purpose** |This feature class is part of the planimetrics database used by the NYC DOITT GIS group to maintain and distribute an accurate 'basemap' for NYC. The basemap provides the foundation upon virtually all other geospatial data with New York. Digital planimetrics are derived using the imagery products delivered with the 2014 New York Statewide Flyover (see Summary for specific flight dates), which includes raw imagery collected to support the generation of 0.5 Ft Ground Sample Distance (GSD) natural color imagery. 
**Description** |The PARK feature class contains both the PARK BOUNDARY for NYC Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) designated parks, as well as the following Park features, which are often within (overlapping) the park boundaries.<br>BASEBALL/SOFTBALL FIELD = Baseball or softball fields<br>BASKETBALL COURT = Basketball courts<br>HANDBALL COURT = Handball courts<br>MULTIPURPOSE COURT = Multiuse areas<br>TENNIS COURT = Tennis courts<br>VOLLEYBALL COURT = Volleyball courts<br>FOOTBALL FIELD = Football fields<br>SOCCER FIELD = Soccer fields<br>GOLF COURSE = Golf courses<br>POOLS = Public pool areas<br>TRACK- Running track<br>SKATING RINK = Skating or hockey rink<br>GREENSTREETS = These coincide with DPR Greenstreet dataset. Park adjacent to road.

## 2. Data Quality and Specifications
---------------------------------------------
|     |     |
| --- | --- |
**Horizontal Coordinate System** |New York State Plane Coordinates, Long Island East Zone, NAD83, US foot
**Resolution** |NA
**Spatial Coverage** |New York City, NY
**Temporal Coverage** |For this dataset, the source imagery was captured on the following dates:<br>Manhattan - June 24, 2014<br>The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island  - April 1st through April 25th, 2014<br>Final delivery of all imagery - April 10, 2015<br>Using this orthoimagery, the planimetric base layers were updated citywide starting in March 2015 and were completed in February 2016.
**Positional Accuracy** |The following features were captured for each subtype: <br>Park Boundary: Outline the outer perimeter of any park from DPR Parks Properties.<br>The boundary encompasses the entire park as a single polygon feature, regardless of special features such as baseball diamonds or tennis courts.<br>The delineation of the outer edge of each park boundary is coincident with the "intended" boundary feature, as determined by the Parks Department. Intended boundary feature are curbs, green areas, sidewalks, etc. and vary from park to park. At times, the intended boundary feature varies within the same park.<br><br>Baseball/Softball Field: Outline of the sandy area (diamond) in softball/baseball fields.<br><br>Tennis Court: Only hard surface courts captured<br><br>Football Field: The extent of these features only includes "in-bounds areas", they do not extend to the turf surrounding the playing field (or related "out-of-bounds areas").<br><br>Greenstreets: Using DPR Greenstreets as the definitive source, these areas were updated and attributed using the source data. Name was populated from the SITENAME source column and park numbers were populated from the GISPROPNUM source column.
**Features Captured** |The following features were excluded from each subtype: <br>Tennis Court: Individual tennis courts within NYC Parks were not captured. Private tennis courts (e.g., on roofs or hotels, etc.) were not captured.  <br><br>Golf Course: The outline of greens, tees, fairways, sand traps, shelters, or cart paths were not captured. <br><br> Track: Tracks painted upon concrete surfaces were not captured.
**Features Excluded** |
**Capture and Update Notes** |The following capture notes for each subtype captured:<br>Park Boundary: When the source data had a single boundary polygon extending across other planimetric features (e.g. roads), the planimetric park boundary follows the source data.<br>When there was no apparent physical boundary feature to delineate the Park boundary, the feature was copied "as is" from the source database.<br>Park names (SIGNNAME and source column) and park numbers (GISPROPNUM source column) were transferred from source databases to park boundaries and special features.<br>Interior road systems and special features within parks were not partitioned.<br><br>Baseball/Softball Field: These features can have different sizes and can be also be represented as painted areas on hard surfaces. These features extend back to the backstop of the field and include the 1st and 3rd base coaching boxes.<br><br>Basketball Court: These features can be represented as full or half courts.<br><br>Handball: The hard surface wall was incorporated witin each court. When multiple courts are adjacent to one another, a division line was digitized to partition individual courts.<br><br>Multipurpose Court: These features are composed of mostly hard surface areas with different markings for different activities.<br><br>Tennis Court: In cases of multiple courts, a division line was digitized along outer painted line (baseline and sideline) to partition individual courts. The extent of these features only includes "in-bounds areas", they do not extend to the fence surrounding the tennis court area (or related "out-of-bounds areas").<br><br>Soccer Field: Outline is represent by extent of grassy surface. <br><br> Greenstreets: All the rules for defining park boundaries were applied for defining Greenstreet limits.
